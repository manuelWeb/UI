  <p style="margin-bottom:1em">Hey macfly,<br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">Yesterday, I told you I had to become good with JavaScript, or die trying. In that moment, I made the best and worst decision of my life simultaneously.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I remember walking into the tiny office that morning, only to be stopped by my project manager. Let’s call him H.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">H wanted me to build a custom carousel for the client. It looked like this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="https://convertkit.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pictures/393/670554/content_Screen_Shot_2017-07-20_at_10.16.20_AM.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I’ve extensively researched carousel plugins a week ago. I knew, from the sight of this component, that I had to code it up. There wasn’t any plugin that could make a two-row carousel. To make matters worse, I had to support single-row carousels as well. I also had to make the component responsive too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I didn’t want to make the component. I couldn’t do it. I didn’t know enough JavaScript. I only knew basic jQuery – some DOM traversals and class manipulation. That’s all I could do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I protested. I came up with the best excuse I could. “This component takes a lot of work. Plus, we’re already behind schedule. If we try to make this, we’re never going to launch on time”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">H gave me the ultimate question: “How long?”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I had to give an estimate. I feared if I don’t, I’ll be labeled as a shitty developer. I’ll never get any work again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">“Four days”. I said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">“Do it”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">Fuck me. I nearly fainted.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">My fate is sealed. My reputation goes to shit if I fail this. I have to deliver a prototype in four days. There’s no way out of this mess now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">To make the custom carousel, I had to make a jQuery plugin (jQuery was required to write any decent cross-browser JavaScript then). I can’t do that yet, not with my current skills.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I did the only thing I could think of – I took the closest plugin I could find. Ripped it apart. Studied it. Then, try to build my component from the ground up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">Long story short, I got struck with countless new concepts, banged my head on a solid brick wall and felt incredibly stupid for a few (three, to be precise) nights</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">Somehow, I managed to make a prototype of the plugin by the fourth day. It was still shit. I only made the double-row carousel part. No single-row carousels, no responsive, no swiping functionality. None of the frills that would make the component work as it ideally should.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I delivered the prototype nevertheless. The client was happy that their “vision” worked. I saved my ass for now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">From the outside, this was just another moment where a developer showed a prototype.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">What I told myself on the inside, however, was a completely different story.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I used to think it was impossible for me to learn JavaScript. I didn’t have a CS degree or any programming background. This moment changed everything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I built a component.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">I started believing can learn JavaScript. I can get better. Looking back, this was the moment that changed everything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">From this moment onwards, I told myself I to build all components from scratch. It was redefining. I learned a ton with each component. My JavaScripts became better over time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">Now, JavaScript doesn’t faze me. I’m confident I can find a solution for any potential problems I face, even if no solutions are present on Google.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">That’s the story of how I learned JavaScript. The story of my aha-moment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">What’s your story with JavaScript? Did you manage to get good enough? Or are you still stuck? I’d love to hear your story. Write back and let me know!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">Stay awesome,<br>
Zell</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1em">PS: They say the best way to learn is to make a public comment to deliver. It’s true. But there’s too much risk involved. There’s a less risky way to get awesome with JavaScript without the stress and overwhelm. Tell you about it tomorrow.</p>
